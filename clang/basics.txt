   static variable:  whose lifetime extends across the entire run of the program
   > Static global variables: variables declared as static at the top level of a source
     file (outside any function definitions) are only visible throughout that
	 file ("file scope", also known as "internal linkage").
   > Static local variables: variables declared as static inside a function are statically
      allocated while having the same scope as automatic local variables. Hence whatever
	  values the function puts into its static local variables during one call will still
	  be present when the function is called again.
